# COVID-19 Time Series Analysis

This repository contains Python code for performing time series analysis on COVID-19 data using the Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing model. The code visualizes and predicts COVID-19 cases for a specific country (in this case, the United States).

## Dataset

The COVID-19 dataset is sourced from [Johns Hopkins University (JHU) GitHub](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19). It includes time series data of confirmed COVID-19 cases globally.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Statsmodels
- Scikit-learn

Install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib statsmodels scikit-learn


Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/covid-time-series-analysis.git


Navigate to the project folder:
cd covid-time-series-analysis


Run the Python script:
python covid_prediction.py
